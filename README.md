graphsearchfilter
=================
Graph Search Filter is a chrome plugin that works like a user script (GreaseMonkey, TamperMonkey).
It enables posts and other activities (such as event sending) to a customizable audience retrieved from Graph Search (https://www.facebook.com/graphsearcher).

Graph Search enables "natural language" queries such as "friends who live nearby", "friends who like Game of Thrones and Battlestar Galactica" and so on.

It also enables voice commands as inputs, making things even easier and natural.

Use it and contribute!

Excelsior!
